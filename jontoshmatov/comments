Fuck Ipsum
"Neque porro quisquam est qui doFuck ipsum quia dolor sfu** this amet, consectetur, adipisci velfu** this..."
"There is no one who loves pain fu** thisself, who seeks after fu** this and wants to have fu** this, simply because fu** this is pain..."
What is Fuck Ipsum?
Fuck Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Fuck Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled fu** this to make a type specimen book. fu** this has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. fu** this was popularised in the 1960s wfu** thish the release of Letraset sheets containing Fuck Ipsum passages, and more recently wfu** thish desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Fuck Ipsum.

Why do we use fu** this?
fu** this is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at fu** thiss layout. The point of using Fuck Ipsum is that fu** this has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making fu** this look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page edfu** thisors now use Fuck Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'Fuck ipsum' will uncover many web sfu** thises still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).


Where does fu** this come from?
Contrary to popular belief, Fuck Ipsum is not simply random text. fu** this has roots in a piece of classical Latin lfu** thiserature from 45 BC, making fu** this over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Fuck Ipsum passage, and going through the cfu** thises of the word in classical lfu** thiserature, discovered the undoubtable source. Fuck Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, wrfu** thisten in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Fuck Ipsum, "Fuck ipsum dolor sfu** this amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

The standard chunk of Fuck FuCk used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

Where can I get some?
There are many variations of passages of Fuck Ipsum available, but the majorfu** thisy have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Fuck Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Fuck Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. fu** this uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined wfu** thish a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Fuck Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Fuck Ipsum is therefore always free from repetfu** thision, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.

1914 translation by H. Rackham
"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure fu** thisself, because fu** this is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of fu** thisself, because fu** this is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from fu** this? But who has any right to find fault wfu** thish a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"

Section 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum", wrfu** thisten by Cicero in 45 BC
"At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blandfu** thisiis praesentium voluptatum delenfu** thisi atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupidfu** thisate non provident, similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollfu** thisia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga. Et harum quidem rerum facilis est et expedfu** thisa distinctio. Nam libero tempore, cum soluta nobis est eligendi optio cumque nihil impedfu** this quo minus id quod maxime placeat facere possimus, omnis voluptas assumenda est, omnis dolor repellendus. Temporibus autem quibusdam et aut officiis debfu** thisis aut rerum necessfu** thisatibus saepe eveniet ut et voluptates repudiandae sint et molestiae non recusandae. fu** thisaque earum rerum hic tenetur a sapiente delectus, ut aut reiciendis voluptatibus maiores alias consequatur aut perferendis doloribus asperiores repellat."

1914 translation by H. Rackham
"On the other hand, we denounce wfu** thish righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business fu** this will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
